# Activities
This is a template for Java activities we will do in class.

At the beginning of the year all programmers will make a branch on this repository, with the name [Firstname][Lastname]\_Activites.
All of the changes you need to make will be marked with a comment like this: `//TODO: 1. lorem ipsum`, and it is recommended to do them in order (`//TODO: 1.` first, `//TODO: 2.` second)

So, **YOU DO NOT NEED TO MAKE CHANGES UNLESS THERE IS A `//TODO:` COMMENT THERE**

To submit an activity, make the changes on your computer in [Activity_1/src/main/java/frc/robot](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Activities_Templates/tree/main/Activity_1/src/main/java/frc/robot) (or whichever Activity) then pull request it to your branch.
Whenever a new activity is made, we will push it to the main branch, and everyone needs to pull it to their branch to work on. For an overview of the activities, or if you want an activity earlier, [here is the doc with the activities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D31dcSFLvubKtJAniKbeGrFRw9ny26ZXfW1ZlzOTUI/edit?usp=sharing).
