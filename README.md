# Activities
This is a template for Java activities we will do in class.

At the beginning of the year all programmers will make a branch on this repository, with the name [Firstname][Lastname]\_Activites.
All of the changes you need to make will be marked with a comment like this: `//TODO: 1. lorem ipsum`, and it is recommended to do them in order (`//TODO: 1.` first, `//TODO: 2.` second)

To submit an activity, make the changes on your computer in [Activity_1/src/main/java/frc/robot](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Activities_Templates/tree/main/Activity_1/src/main/java/frc/robot) (or whichever Activity) then pull request it to your branch. To see the instructions for the activites, [here is the doc with the activities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D31dcSFLvubKtJAniKbeGrFRw9ny26ZXfW1ZlzOTUI/edit?usp=sharing).
